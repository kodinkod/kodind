**Agentic programs** are the gateway to the outside world for LLMs, code, ~~people~~. We can identify several levels of agency:

| Agency Level | Description | How that's called | Example Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ☆☆☆ | LLM output has no impact on program flow | Simple processor | `process_llm_output(llm_response)` |
| ★☆☆ | LLM output determines basic control flow | Router | `if llm_decision(): path_a() else: path_b()` |
| ★★☆ | LLM output determines function execution | Tool call | `run_function(llm_chosen_tool, llm_chosen_args)` |
| ★★★ | LLM output controls iteration and program continuation | Multi-step Agent | `while llm_should_continue(): execute_next_step()` |
| ★★★ | One agentic workflow can start another agentic workflow | Multi-Agent | `if llm_trigger(): execute_agent()` |

## ⛔ When to use agents
| **Advantages (+) of Using Agents**                                                                 | **Disadvantages (-) of Using Agents**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flexibility**: Agents can adapt to complex and uncertain tasks that don’t fit predefined workflows. | **Complexity**: Agents are harder to develop and debug compared to deterministic systems.           |
| **Autonomy**: Agents can make independent decisions based on data and context.                    | **Unpredictability**: Agents may make unexpected or incorrect decisions due to ambiguous data.      |
| **Scalability**: Agents can handle a wide range of tasks by leveraging various tools (APIs, databases, etc.). | **Cost**: Using agents can be more expensive due to the need for powerful computational resources.  |
| **Real-world applicability**: Agents excel at tasks requiring analysis of multiple factors and context. | **Risk of errors**: Agents may make mistakes, especially with incomplete or conflicting data.       |
| **Integration with external systems**: Agents can interact with APIs, databases, and other tools. | **Control challenges**: It’s harder to control and explain agent behavior in complex scenarios.     |
| **Suitable for complex tasks**: Agents are useful when tasks require analyzing multiple variables. | **Overkill for simple tasks**: Agents may add unnecessary complexity for straightforward tasks.     |
