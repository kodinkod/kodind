**Agentic programs** are the gateway to the outside world for LLMs, code, ~~people~~.

| Agency Level | Description | How that's called | Example Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ☆☆☆ | LLM output has no impact on program flow | Simple processor | `process_llm_output(llm_response)` |
| ★☆☆ | LLM output determines basic control flow | Router | `if llm_decision(): path_a() else: path_b()` |
| ★★☆ | LLM output determines function execution | Tool call | `run_function(llm_chosen_tool, llm_chosen_args)` |
| ★★★ | LLM output controls iteration and program continuation | Multi-step Agent | `while llm_should_continue(): execute_next_step()` |
| ★★★ | One agentic workflow can start another agentic workflow | Multi-Agent | `if llm_trigger(): execute_agent()` |
