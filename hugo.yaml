             I created this resource to collect everything that helps me learn new things. There will be `frameworks, articles, code, photos, books, bots, and just plain text`.  I am constantly updating the collection, adding new, relevant and useful resources. 
             
             **The purpose of this project goes beyond personal experience.**Â I am convinced that access to high-quality knowledge can change the world. When everyone can easily understand technology, it will not only accelerate progress, but also protect society from speculation and manipulation using AI technologies.
             
              If you are here, then you know how difficult it is to find complete, open and verified information from first-hand sources, and perhaps you have already started maintaining your knowledge base in Notion or obsidian. If you have found what you were looking for or you have something to tell the world, welcome to contribute. **TLet's make modern knowledge and experience more accessible together.**
